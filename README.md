# RPG Statistics Screen for Minecraft Modpack
This Mod is for my modpack, trying to implement Roles and Bonuses etc.
Is supposed to enhance Minecraft in a way where you can experience different Playthroughs instead of the same old Minecraft.

# Leveling System
## Level
Your Character Level will define a few things, first and foremost, what kind of Stats you have, per 2 levels you will get one Stat point, which you can spend however you'd like. (Except larry, he gets one each level.)
You can Increase your level by beating Challenges and fullfilling quests.

It will also affect what kind of Tools, Weapons and Armor you can use. For Example, you won't be able to wear Diamond Armor before level 30.

## Level Progression & Quests
### Level Progression
I'd like to keep progression quite slow, so while Quests and Challenges will be "easy" at the start, they won't give much XP.
Being restricted in both, Armor and Stats will also increase the amount of time they take to Complete.
### Quests and Challenges
The Quests and Challenges in this Mod are based on your level, they usually change in difficulty every 10 Levels but this will decrease in higher Level-Ranges.

#### Quest Examples Level 0-10
- Farm 100 wheat
- Kill 20 Zombies
- Farm 100 Wood-Logs.
- Survive 10 In-game days Without Dying

### Quest Examples Level 95-100
- Kill the enderdragon while having no Armor, or Food.
- Kill 4 Wardens with a Sword in 5 Minutes.
- Fight certain Endboss.
- Figure out the Meaning of life.
